Order Reminders
================

From 2009 until 2014, Kinento has sold the Magento Order Reminders module for 79 euro per license. From 2015 onwards, updates are no longer provided by Kinento, but the module is instead available on GitHub free of charge. The code is released under the MIT open-source license and community patches and feature additions are encouraged.

Included is the original PDF manual (manual.pdf) and the Magento Connect description (below).

Module description
================

To make sure your customers pay on time, Kinento's Order Reminders module provides you with an automatic reminder email based on order statuses. The module gives you an overview of all orders that are waiting for payment, including data on the amount of sent reminders. With invoice or proforma attachments, a multiple-fase reminder system and different settings for prepaid or onaccount customers, Order Reminders provides the wanted functionality for any webshop. 

Two modules
-------------

Invoice Reminders is similar to Order Reminders, but is based on the status of invoices instead of the status of orders. 

Email templates
-------------

Three templates for a first, second, and for further reminder emails are provided, including all relevant order data. Additionally, the templates are customizable from within Magento (Transactional Emails), allowing to incorporate your wishes and represent your webshop's unique style. 

Attachment support
-------------

Depending on your decisions, customers might be able to pay in advance or after shipment. Order Reminders therefore supports both the attachment of a proforma document or an invoice. Options are available to indicate which customer groups will receive which attachment.
